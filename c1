<!--
this file is a new .html file for storing many Internet links that I find.  Organized by:
1) Roger Walsh's "8 ways to wellness"
Recreation, 
Relax, 
Relationships(1.Connect with the people around you.), 
Repay or giving back(5.Give.), 
Diet, 
Exercise(2.Be active.), 
Time in Nature, and 
Spirituality. 

2) Shirzad Chamine's "Positive Intelligence"
Empathize, 
Explore, 
Navigate, 
Innovate, & 
Activate. 
3) (Five Ways to Well-being are a set of evidence-based actions which promote people’s wellbeing: Connect, Be Active, Take Notice, Keep Learning and Give)
(3.Be curious.  Mindfulness, in which you deliberately pay attention to what you’re sensing, feeling, and thinking, pays off in a heightened sense of self-determination over your behavior.) 
(4.Keep learning.)
